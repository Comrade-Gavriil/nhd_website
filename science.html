                        <p class="arg">The application of complex numbers does not just stop at the theoretical world of math, but applies to many fields in science as well. Fluid Dynamics is one field where complex numbers come in handy. The navier-stokes equations model the flow of fluids with all types of boundary conditions and fluid variables. Claude-Louis Navier first invented the equations to model fluids, but Sir George Stokes popularized the use of replacing the real vector component with an imaginary vector component. This was a breakthrough in the field and would give many tricks for physicists to use for solving fluid flow.

                        <p class="arg">Quantum Mechanics is another field that uses complex numbers. In the case of the Schrödinger equation (a building block of modern day quantum mechanics), the complex plane is necessary in deriving the equation. Before the generalized quantum model was created by Erwin Schrödinger many before him used complex numbers to describe light particles. Einstein, for example, popularized these methods in special relativity. Schrödinger was the first to break out of classical electromagnetics with derivation of the equation.

                    <p class="quote">"One might think this means that imaginary numbers are just a mathematical game having nothing to do with the real world. From the viewpoint of positivist philosophy, however, one cannot determine what is real. All one can do is find which mathematical models describe the universe we live in. It turns out that a mathematical model involving imaginary time predicts not only effects we have already observed but also effects we have not been able to measure yet nevertheless believe in for other reasons. So what is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds?"<br> ~ Stephen Hawking</p>

                        <p class="arg">Another extremely important concept is the fourier transform created by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician. The fourier transform equations utilize complex numbers and Euler’s formula. They are some of the most useful equations as they are used in many different types of science and math, including fourier transform spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, signal processing, analyzing differential equations, electromagnetism, and in many other science and math fields. Electromagnetism plays a huge role in electrical engineering which has greatly progressed technology and, by proxy, all of humanity.
