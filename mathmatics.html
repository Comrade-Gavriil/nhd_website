Since the function is cubic it must have three roots as the fundamental theorem of algebra states. In this case all of the roots are real.</p>

The fundamental theorem of algebra, although not rigorously proven until the 1800s, has been used in many important ways developing algebra as well as other fields that make use of it.</p>

                    <p class="quote">It has often been said that attempts to 
                        prove the fundamental theorem began with d’Alembert (1746),
                         and that the first satisfactory proof was given by Gauss 
                         (1799). This opinion should not be accepted without question,
                          as the source of it is Gauss himself. Gauss(1799) gave a
                           critique of proofs from d’Alembert on, showing that they 
                           all had serious weaknesses, then offered a proof of his 
                           own. His intention was to convince readers that the new
                            proof was the first valid one, even though it used one
                             unproved assumption . . . . The opinion as to which of
                              two incomplete proofs is more convincing can of course
                               change with time, and I believe that Gauss (1799) 
                               might be judged differently today. We can now fill 
                               the gaps in d’Alembert(1746) by appeal to standard
                                methods and theorems, whereas there is still no 
                                easy way to fill the gap in Gauss (1799)

                        <p class="arg">The grounds for complex analysis would be laid out by French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy who used the assumption that a complex number could be an input for a function and consequently an output. This was relatively unimportant to his peers as he was just a new mathematician. But his methods inspired many later to come. Complex analysis is the study of the properties of complex numbers. Many great mathematicians have contributed to its advancement, providing useful formulas and intuitions about other fields in math and science.

                    <p class="quote">"Complete knowledge of the nature of an analytic 
                        function must also include insight into its behavior for imaginary
                         values of the arguments. Often the latter is indispensable 
                         even for a proper appreciation of the behavior of the
                          function for real arguments. It is therefore essential
                           that the original determination of the function concept 
                           be broadened to a domain of magnitudes which includes both
                            the real and the imaginary quantities, on an equal footing,

                        <p class="arg">Euler first invented the current day Riemann zeta function but because complex numbers were not as accessible at the time he did not use them. However, the function’s namesake comes from German mathematician Bernhard Reimann who applied complex numbers like Cauchy and put the complex numbers into the function.
                            The Riemann zeta function is a link to understanding many intriguing facets of math, including understanding the pattern of prime numbers which could improve mathematical understanding greatly. Complex numbers and analysis play a crucial role in understanding the Riemann zeta function which is the frontier for mathematical advancement.
