                        <p class="arg">The fundamental theorem of algebra wouldn’t have ever been discovered without the discovery of imaginary roots as implemented by Descartes and Wallis. The fundamental theorem of algebra has been used in many important ways developing algebra as well as other fields that make use of it.</p>

                        <p class="arg">The grounds for complex analysis would be laid out by french mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy he used the assumption that a complex number could be an input for a function and consequently and output. This was relatively unimportant to his peers as he was just a new mathematician. But his methods inspired many later to come.</p>

                        <p class="arg">Euler first invented the current day Riemann zeta function but because complex numbers weren’t as accessible at the time he didn’t use them. However the function’s namesake comes from german mathematician Bernhard Reimann who applied complex numbers like Cauchy and put the complex numbers into the function. The Riemann zeta function is a link to understanding many intriguing facets of math including understanding the pattern of prime numbers which could improve mathematical understanding greatly. Complex numbers and analysis play a crucial role in understanding the Riemann zeta function which is the frontier for mathematical advancement.</p>
