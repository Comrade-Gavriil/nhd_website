                        <p class="arg">In the early 800s Al-Khwarizmi, one of the first directors of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, created the foundation for Algebra. He created a technique for solving quadratic equations which led to a general quadratic formula. Unfortunately for these arabic mathematicians not every equation had real solution, and they got the square roots of negative numbers for those specific equations. Even though they didn't acknowledge the importance of these imaginary numbers, their discoveries led to interest in these solutions and eventually to the modern development of complex numbers.

                        <p class="arg">During the 11th century Abraham bar Hiyya, a jewish mathematician living in spain, translated and compiled Islamic and Indian based mathematics including the quadratic formula. Continuing the movement of Abraham, Plato de Tivoli compiled Abrahamâ€™s work into the liber embadum which went to inspire european mathematicians during the middle ages. However these texts weren't the only mathematical intellectual property brought to Europe, because Leonardo de Pisa (Fibonacci)  also learned and translated Islamic mathematics into works like Liber Abaci. During this transition, Fibonacci also was the first to develop the standardized cubic equation.

                        <p class="arg">As commerce developed in Europe, traders used mathematics to become strategically advantageous. This led to the popularity of mathematicians and the creation of many logical formulas based upon the original rule sets used for commerce, evolving the field past the original physical ties.
