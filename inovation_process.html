However, there were many unsolvable cases where the number of roots was not equal to 3 because he came across the square root of negative numbers.                        </p>

                        in mystery and surrounded by darkness, it is largely an unsuitable terminology which should be blamed. 
                        Had +1, -1 and √ −1, instead of being called positive, negative and imaginary (or worse still, impossible) 
                        unity, been given the names say,of direct, inverse and lateral unity, there would hardly have been any scope

He provided a method for solving quadratic and cubic equations in his <em>Ars Magna</em>. In the section on postulating a negative, he calls the answer a new number, terming it the “true negative”

                        a major breakthrough in mathemat ics. Several Italian
                         mathematicians figured out how to solve cubic equations 
                         and fourth degree equations as well. But as we see in Girolamo Cardano's
                         Ars Magna (Cardano, 1968), the basic principle here was 
                         the same as in the solution of quadratic equations." <br> ~Victor J. Katz</p>

In his <em>Algebra</em>, he attempted to prove imaginary numbers using constructions in two and three dimensions, believing that there must be a geometric proof for his newfound class of numbers. Although unsuccessful, he provided many ideas and a basis for other mathematicians to improve upon.</p>
