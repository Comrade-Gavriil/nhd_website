                            up with the solution to the cubic equation x<sup>3</sup>+ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0 however, there were many unsolvable 
                            cases where the number of roots wasn’t equal to 3 because he came across the square root of 
                            negative numbers.</p>

                        in mystery and surrounded by darkness, it is largely an unsuitable terminology which should be blamed. 
                        Had +1, -1 and √ −1, instead of being called positive, negative and imaginary (or worse still, impossible) 
                        unity, been given the names say,of direct, inverse and lateral unity, there would hardly have been any scope

Several Italian mathematicians figured out how to solve cubic equations and fourth degree equations as well. But as we see in Girolamo Cardano's Ars Magna (Cardano, 1968), the basic principle here was the same as in the solution of quadratic equations.</q>

                            In his <em>Algebra</em>, he attempted to prove imaginary numbers using constructions in two and 
                            three dimensions believing that there must be a geometric proof for his newfound class of numbers. Although unsuccessful, he provided many ideas and a basis for other mathematicians to improve upon.</p>
